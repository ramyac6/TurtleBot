# TurtleBot

A fun experiment learning how to use Discord.js and GitHub. 
Turtlebot is a bot that I and some friends are messing around with.

## Current Implementations

### Commands

All commands start with the prefix (Ex. `<git`)

- git
    - Returns this GitHub URL
- hug `<username>`
    - Sends a hug to you or another user
- ping
    - Gives response time
- reload `<command>`
    - Refreshes code for a command so you don't have to restart the bot
- repeat
    - Sends your message through the bot for some spookiness
        - All messages sent through this command are logged in another server in case or problems


### Fun Stuff
Some of our friends have some verbal tendencies, so we added features that respond to certain key phrases
- hmm
    - Correct
- Good morning
    - It's afternoon...

## Future Ideas
- help
    - Gives list of commands and use cases
- countdown `<eventname>`
    - Countdown timer to events in the future
        - FRC Kickoff, Champs, visits, etc
- quote
    - Returns an out of context quote
    - Guessing game?
- convert `<amount>`
    - Conversions for timezones, currency, temperature, etc
- emoji `<name>`
    - Nitro emoji control by bot
- purge `<number>`
    - So I don't have to keep cleaning out my test server
